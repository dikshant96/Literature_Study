@article{Srinivasan2011,
abstract = {The turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) is an important parameter in modeling turbulent transport, and a lot of effort has been placed in studying its behavior in wall turbulence. This work applied the Churchill model for turbulence scaling to determine the Prt. Two different computational approaches involving a direct numerical simulation in conjunction with Lagrangian techniques were utilized. In the first approach, the local fractions of shear stress and heat flux density, as defined using Churchill's scaling model and determined previously by Le and Papavassiliou [Le, P. M.; Papavassiliou, D. V. On temperature prediction at low Re turbulent flows using the Churchill turbulent heat flux correlation. Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer.2006, 49, 3681-3690], were used to calculate the Prt. For Poiseuille channel flow, the Prt, at distances far away from the channel walls, was found to have a value between 0.8 and 0.9 irrespective of the molecular Prandtl number, while for plane Couette flow, it was found to be between 0.7 and 1.5. An alternative approach to determining the Prt is to translate Churchill's physical interpretation of Prt in a Lagrangian sense. Contributions of turbulent and molecular transport to momentum and heat transfer were calculated to find the local fractions of shear stress and heat flux density. For both Poiseuille channel and Couette flows, the Prt at Pr = 0.1 in regions near the center of the channel was higher than that at higher Pr. For Pr {\textgreater} 0.7, in the case of Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow, the Prt started from values above 1 decreased and then followed a similar trend to that of the lower molecular Pr. The near-wall Prt increased with increasing Pr for both types of turbulent flow. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the pressure-scrambling terms (i.e., the pressure-strain and pressuregradient-scalar covariances) in the Reynolds-stress and scalar-flux budgets for cloud-topped boundarylayers (CTBLs) is performed using high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES). Two CTBLs are simulated —one with trade wind shallow cumuli, and the other with nocturnal marine stratocumuli. The pressure-scrambling terms are decomposed into contributions due to turbulence-turbulence interactions, meanvelocity shear, buoyancy, and Coriolis effects. Commonly used models of these contributions, including asimple linear model most often used in geophysical applications and a more sophisticated two-component-limit (TCL) nonlinear model, are tested against the LES data. The decomposition of the pressure-scramblingterms shows that the turbulence-turbulence and buoyancy contributions are most significant for cloud-topped boundary layers. The Coriolis contribution is negligible. The shear contribution is generally of minorimportance inside the cloudy layers, but it is the leading-order contribution near the surface. A comparisonof models of the pressure-scrambling terms with the LES data suggests that the more complex TCL model issuperior to the simple linear model only for a few contributions. The linear model is able to reproduce theprincipal features of the pressure-scrambling terms reasonably well. It can be applied in the second-orderturbulence modeling of cloud-topped boundary layer flows, provided some uncertainties are tolerated.},

@article{Coletti2013,
abstract = {The present study experimentally investigates a turbulent jet in crossflow relevant to film cooling applications. The jet is inclined at 30°, and its mean velocity is the same as the crossflow. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to obtain the full three-dimensional velocity and concentration fields, whereas Reynolds stresses are obtained along selected planes by Particle Image Velocimetry. The critical role of the counter-rotating vortex pair in the mixing process is apparent from both velocity and concentration fields. The jet entrainment is not significantly higher than in an axisymmetric jet without crossflow, because the proximity of the wall inhibits the turbulent transport. Reynolds shear stresses correlate with velocity and concentration gradients, consistent with the fundamental assumptions of simple turbulence models. However the eddy viscosity is strongly anisotropic and non-homogeneous, being especially low along the leeward side of the jet close to injection. Turbulent diffusion acts to decouple mean velocity and concentration fields, as demonstrated by the drop in concentration flux within the streamtube issued from the hole. Volume-averaged turbulent diffusivity is calculated using a mass–flux balance across the streamtube emanating from the jet hole, and it is found to vary slowly in the streamwise direction. The data are compared with Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with standard k−$\epsilon$ closure and an optimal turbulent Schmidt number. The computations underestimate the strength of the counter-rotating vortex pair, due to an overestimated eddy viscosity. On the other hand the entrainment is increasingly underpredicted downstream of injection. To capture the correct macroscopic trends, eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity should vary spatially in different ways. Therefore a constant turbulent Schmidt number formulation is inadequate for this flow.},

abstract = {Algebraic closures for the turbulent scalar fluxes were evaluated for a discrete hole film cooling geometry using the results from the high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of Bodart et al. [1]. Several models for the turbulent scalar fluxes exist, including the widely used Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis, the Generalized Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis [2], and the Higher Order Generalized Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis [3]. By analyzing the results from the LES, it was possible to isolate the error due to these turbulent mixing models. Distributions of the turbulent diffusivity, turbulent viscosity, and turbulent Prandtl number were extracted from the LES results. It was shown that the turbulent Prandtl number varies significantly spatially, undermining the applicability of the Reynolds analogy for this flow. The LES velocity field and Reynolds stresses were fed into a RANS solver to calculate the fluid temperature distribution. This analysis revealed in which regions of the flow various modeling assumptions were invalid and what effect those assumptions had on the predicted temperature distribution.},

abstract = {The behaviour of passive-scalar fields resulting from mean scalar gradients in each of three orthogonal directions in homogeneous turbulent shear flow has been studied using direct numerical simulations of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with 128 × 128 × 128 grid points. It is found that, for all orientations of the mean scalar gradient, the sum of the pressure-scalar gradient and velocity gradient-scalar gradient terms in the turbulent scalar flux balance equation are approximately aligned with the scalar flux vector itself. In addition, the time derivative of the scalar flux is also approximately aligned with the flux vector for the developed fields (corresponding to roughly constant correlation coefficients). These alignments lead directly to a gradient transport model with a tensor turbulent diffusivity. The simulation results are used to fit a dimensionless model coefficient as a function of the turbulence Reynolds and P{\'{e}}clet numbers. The model is tested against two different passive-scalar fields in fully developed turbulent channel flow (also generated by direct numerical simulation) and is found to predict the scalar flux quite well throughout the entire channel.},

@article{Weatheritt2019,
abstract = {The classical gradient-diffusion hypothesis has known deficiencies when applied to cooling applications. In this paper, the gene-expression programming (GEP) method, a machine learning approach, has been applied to develop scalar-flux models via symbolic regression. The scalar-flux, the unclosed term of the mean passive-scalar transport equation, is treated by considering the polynomial basis and scalar invariants available from computable Reynolds-averaged quantities. This method has been applied to develop and then assess a model for the test case of jet in crossflow. A high-fidelity database was first probed for insight into which of the candidate bases are the most suitable as modelling terms. The high dimensionality of the function space, spanned by the basis, was then reduced by basic statistical techniques. The resulting data-driven model is presented and tested for a range of different jet in crossflow cases. Compared with eddy-diffusivity models, the new model is shown to produce reliably more accurate results. This demonstrates that the current framework can be used for scalar-flux modelling in complex three-dimensional flows and has potential to provide generalized form closures with improved predictive accuracy for the same classes of flows they were trained on.},

The validity of the present k - $\epsilon$ model was tested by application to basic and complex flows such as flows with injection and suction, flows with strong adverse and favorable pressure gradients, and flows with separation and reattachment, while comparing the relevant DNS and reliable experimental data. Fundamental properties of the proposed k1 - $\epsilon$1 model were first verified in basic flows under arbitrary wall thermal boundary conditions and next in backward-facing step flows at various Prandtl numbers through a comparison of the predictions with the DNS and measurements. These comparisons have proven that the proposed models for both velocity and thermal fields have wide applicability to science and engineering and have sufficient capability to perform highly stable computations at any Prandtl numbers, irrespective of flow configurations. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) programs have a wide application field in reactor tech- nique, like to diverse flow types which have to be considered in Accelerator Driven nuclear reactor Systems (ADS). This requires turbulence models for the momentum and heat trans- fer with very different capabilities. The physical demands on the models are elaborated for selected transport mechanisms, the status quo of the modelling is discussed, and it is inves- tigated which capabilities are offered by the market dominating commercial CFD codes. One topic of the discussion is on the already earlier achieved knowledge on the distinct anisotropy of the turbulent momentum and heat transport near walls. It is shown that this is relevant in channel flows with inhomogeneous wall conditions. The related consequences for the turbu- lence modelling are discussed. The second topic is the turbulent heat transport in buoyancy influenced flows. The only turbu- lence model for heat transfer which is available in the large commercial CFD-codes is based on the Reynolds analogy. This means, it is required to prescribe suitable turbulent Prandtl number distributions. There exist many correlations for channel flows, but they are seldom used in practical applications. Here, a correlation is deduced for the local turbulent Prandtl number which accounts for many parameters, like wall distance, molecular Prandtl number of the fluid, wall roughness and local shear stress, thermal wall condition, etc. so that it can be applied to most ADS typical heat transporting channel flows. The spatial dependence is dis- cussed. It is shown that it is essential for reliable temperature calculations to get accurate turbulent Prandtl numbers especially near walls. If thermal wall functions are applied, then the correlation for the turbulent Prandtl number has to be consistent with the wall functions to avoid unphysical discretisation dependences. In using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data for horizontal fluid layers it is shown that the turbulent Prandtl number concept and other available turbulence models have serious deficits in this convection type. Some of the re- spective model improvements are discussed which were recently developed at For- schungszentrum Karlsruhe. Finally, a sketch for a turbulent momentum and heat transfer model is given which summa- rizes the experience from literature and our own results. It is based on extended algebraic stress and heat flux models which use in total four or five transport equations for turbulence quantities. According to all experience one may expect that this model will give considerably improved results for the anisotropic transport in forced, mixed, and buoyant convection in fluids with different molecular Prandtl numbers. Therefore, it should be implemented in a CFD code and should be investigated in more detail.},

abstract = {A process has been developed by which mean velocity and concentration measurements can be used to determine optimal turbulent diffusivity values for an angled jet in cross-flow configuration. This configuration has applications in film cooling for gas turbine blades. The measurements, obtained by magnetic resonance imaging techniques, provide 3D time-averaged velocity and concentration fields. The mean velocity field is fed into a Reynolds-Averaged Advection Diffusion solver, which uses a turbulent diffusivity model to solve for the mean coolant concentration distribution. This distribution can be compared to the experimentally-obtained concentration field by means of an error metric that quantifies the difference between the computational and experimental concentration fields. By minimizing this error, an optimal value of the turbulent diffusivity can be determined. This optimized distribution is then compared to a RANS simulation to evaluate the relative contribution to error of the turbulent momentum flux model versus the turbulent scalar flux model.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} This work describes the derivation of an algebraic model for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in stably stratified turbulent flows, which are mutually coupled for this type of flow. For general two-dimensional mean flows, we present a correct way of expressing the Reynolds-stress anisotropy and the (normalized) turbulent heat flux as tensorial combinations of the mean strain rate, the mean rotation rate, the mean temperature gradient and gravity. A system of linear equations is derived for the coefficients in these expansions, which can easily be solved with computer algebra software for a specific choice of the model constants. The general model is simplified in the case of parallel mean shear flows where the temperature gradient is aligned with gravity. For this case, fully explicit and coupled expressions for the Reynolds-stress tensor and heat-flux vector are given. A self-consistent derivation of this model would, however, require finding a root of a polynomial equation of sixth-order, for which no simple analytical expression exists. Therefore, the nonlinear part of the algebraic equations is modelled through an approximation that is close to the consistent formulation.

@article{Reynolds1975,
abstract = {This paper examines more than thirty ways of predicting the relationship between turbulent transfers of momentum and a passive contaminant such as heat or dissolved matter. The models are divided into seven classes, on the basis of method of derivation or field of application. Three classes comprise modifications of the simplest mixing-length model to allow for diffusion during the lateral motion of the fluid element which is conceived to carry the transferred entities. The other four classes are more heterogeneous: formal analyses based on Reynolds equations; results derived from various expressions for the eddy diffusivities; several kinds of model applicable to wall layers in particular; and purely empirical formulae representing limited data. An attempt has been made to assess the utility and potential for development of these models, both from the practical point of view, that of devising accurate heat- and mass-transfer formulae, and from the fundamental point of view, that of gaining an understanding of the actual transferring mechanisms. There is a plethora of formulae that can, with suitable choices of empirical constants, represent the gross features of experimental data. However, only the formal analyses account in a consistent way for the pressure interactions which influence momentum transfer. At present, formal results are available only for the degenerate case of weak, decaying turbulence, although they do prove useful in suggesting the limiting behaviour to be expected in more general flows. L'article {\'{e}}tudie plus de trente fa{\c{c}}ons de pr{\'{e}}voir la relation entre les transferts turbulents de quantit{\'{e}} de mouvement et d'un contaminant passif tel que la chaleur ou une substance dissoute.

Zur Berechnung der Beziehungen zwischen dem turbulenten Impuls-, W{\"{a}}rme- und Stoffaustausch werden in dieser Arbeit mehr als drei$\beta$ig M{\"{o}}glichkeiten angegeben.

Das einfachste Mischungsl{\"{a}}ngenmodell ist in drei Klassen enthalten; es ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt die Diffusion w{\"{a}}hrend der Querbewegung des Fluidelements. Die anderen vier Klassen sind unterschiedlicher: auf den Gleichungen von Reynolds basierende formale Berechnungen, Ergebnisse, die von verschiedenen Ausdr{\"{u}}cken f{\"{u}}r die Diffusion in Wirbeln abgeleitet wurden, einige Modelle, die besonders auf Grenzschichten an W{\"{a}}nden anwendbar sind und nur in begrenzten Bereichen g{\"{u}}ltige empirische Formeln. Es wurde ein Versuch unternommen, die N{\"{u}}tzlichkeit und Anwendungsm{\"{o}}glichkeikt dieser Modelle zu bewerten, zum einen vom praktischen Standpunkt aus, um genaue W{\"{a}}rme- und Stofftransportgleichungen zu erhalten und zum anderen vom grunds{\"{a}}tzlichen Standpunkt aus, um den wirklichen {\"{U}}bertragungsmechanismus kennenzulernen.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new proposal for closing the energy equation is presented at the two-equation level of turbulence modeling. The eddy diffusivity concept is used in modeling. However, just as the eddy viscosity is determined from solutions of the k and $\epsilon$ equations, so the eddy diffusivity for heat is given as functions of temperature variance t2, and the dissipation rate of temperature fluctuations $\epsilon$t, together with k and $\epsilon$. Thus, the proposed model does not require any questionable assumptions for the “turbulent Prandtl number.” Modeled forms of the t2 and $\epsilon$t equations are developed to account for the physical effects of molecular Prandtl number and near-wall turbulence. The model is tested by application to a flat-plate boundary layer, the thermal entrance region of a pipe, and the turbulent heat transfer in fluids over a wide range of the Prandtl number. Agreement with the experiment is generally very satisfactory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The paper reports on an alternative approach to modelling the turbulent scalar fluxes that arise from time averaging the transport equation for a scalar. In this approach, a functional relationship between these fluxes and various tensor quantities is constructed with guidance from the exact equations governing the transport of fluxes. Results from tensor representation theory are then used to obtain an explicit relationship between the fluxes and the terms in the assumed functional relationship. Where turbulence length- and time-scales are implied, these are determined from two scalar quantities: the turbulence kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation by viscous action. The general representation is then reduced by certain justifiable assumptions to yield a practical model for the turbulent scalar fluxes that is explicit and algebraic in these quantities and one that correctly reflects their dependence on the gradients of mean velocity and on the details of the turbulence. Examination of alternative algebraic models shows most to be subsets of the present proposal. The new model is calibrated using results from large-eddy simulations (LESs) of homogeneous turbulence with passive scalars and then assessed by reference to benchmark data from heated turbulent shear flows. The results obtained show the model to correctly predict the anisotropy of the turbulent diffusivity tensor. The asymmetric nature of this tensor is also recovered, but only qualitatively, there being significant quantitative differences between the model predictions and the LES results. Finally, comparisons with data from benchmark two-dimensional free shear flows show the new model to yield distinct improvements over other algebraic scalar-flux closures. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {A new turbulence model to calculate complex turbulent heat transfer in separating and reattaching flows is proposed. This new model is a modified version of the latest low-Reynolds-number two-equation heat-transfer model, in which the main improvement is achieved by introducing the Kolmogorov velocity scale, u$\epsilon$ ≡ ($\nu$$\epsilon$)1 4, instead of the friction velocity u$\tau$, to account for the near-wall and low-Reynolds-number effects in both attached and detached flows. After investigating the characteristics of various time scales for the heat-transfer model, we adopted a composite time scale which gives weight to a shorter scale among the velocity- and temperature-field time scales. It is validated that the present model predicts quite accurately the turbulent heat transfer in separating and reattaching flows downstream of a backward-facing step, which involve most of the essential physics of complex turbulent heat transfer, under various conditions of flow Reynolds number and upstream boundary-layer thickness. In addition, the computational results have revealed several new mechanistic features of the turbulent heat transfer in separating and reattaching flows. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Direct numerical simulation is used to study passive scalar transport and mixing in a round turbulent jet, in a laminar crossflow. The ratio of the jet velocity to that of the crossflow is 5.7, the Schmidt number of the scalar is 1.49, and the jet-exit Reynolds number is 5000. The scalar field is used to compute entrainment of the crossflow fluid by the jet. It is shown that the bulk of this entrainment occurs on the downstream side of the jet. Also, the transverse jet entrains more fluid than a regular jet even when the jet has not yet bent into the crossflow. The transverse jet's enhanced entrainment is explained in terms of the pressure field around the jet. The acceleration imposed by the crossflow deforms the jet cross-section on the downstream side, which sets up a pressure gradient that drives downstream crossflow fluid toward the jet. The simulation results are used to comment on the applicability of the gradient–diffusion hypothesis to compute passive scalar mixing in this flow field. Computed values of the eddy diffusivity show significant scatter, and a pronounced anisotropy. The near field also exhibits counter gradient diffusion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Yoder2016,
abstract = {In this study, several variable turbulent Prandtl number formulations are examined for boundary layers, pipe flow, and axisymmetric jets. The model formulations include simple algebraic relations between the thermal diffusivity and turbulent viscosity as well as more complex models that solve transport equations for the thermal variance and its dissipation rate. Results are compared with available data for wall heat transfer and profile measurements of mean temperature, the root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuating temperature, turbulent heat flux and turbulent Prandtl number. For wall-bounded problems, the algebraic models are found to best predict the rise in turbulent Prandtl number near the wall as well as the log-layer temperature profile, while the thermal variance models provide a good representation of the RMS temperature fluctuations. In jet flows, the algebraic models provide no benefit over a constant turbulent Prandtl number approach. Application of the thermal variance models finds that some significantly overpredict the temperature variance in the plume and most underpredict the thermal growth rate of the jet. The models yield very similar fluctuating temperature intensities in jets from straight pipes and smooth contraction nozzles, in contrast to data that indicate the latter should have noticeably higher values. For the particular low subsonic heated jet cases examined, changes in the turbulent Prandtl number had no effect on the centerline velocity decay.},

@article{Rossi2010,
abstract = {A numerical study of heat and mass transport based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes and scalar transport equations is presented to establish the predictive capabilities of algebraic flux models compared to the standard eddy-diffusivity representation. The analysis of scalar transport in simple-shear flows is initially performed to provide a basic validation of numerical techniques and scalar flux closures. The evaluation of algebraic models is carried out by examining the flow and scalar transport phenomena over a wavy wall and comparing the results to reliable direct numerical simulations. Despite the similarities with the standard gradient-diffusion hypothesis and the questionable validity of local-equilibrium conditions, the results show that algebraic models provide an efficient way to improve heat and mass transport predictions in complex flows with respect to the standard eddy-diffusivity model. The impact of abandoning the isotropic eddy-diffusivity in favor of a tensorial representation is found particularly significant in the analysis of scalar dispersion from a point source over the wavy wall, where lateral transport comes into play. While it is found that algebraic closures also represent a reasonable approximation for the spanwise scalar flux, the lateral spread of scalar concentration is considerably under-estimated by the standard gradient-diffusion model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Qiu2008,
abstract = {Analogous to an algebraic Reynolds stress model, the algebraic heat flux model (AHFM) is derived from a second-moment closure by invoking the weak-equilibrium condition. The present study investigates this condition in detail as it applies to the advection and diffusive-transport terms. For the advection term, the correct form of this condition in non-inertial frames is obtained by means of an invariant Euclidean transformation. The validity of the diffusive-transport condition is examined through an a priori test using a DNS database for rotating turbulent channel flow with heat transfer. It is shown that the weak-equilibrium condition applied to diffusive-transport term tends to fail in the near-wall region. An alternative form is proposed that is based on an asymptotic analysis of the transport equation budget in the near-wall region. An evaluation of proposed form shows that it has the potential to improve the predictive ability of an ARSM for flows involving system rotation and/or streamline curvature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In order to derive a possible direction for developing Reynolds-averaged algebraic turbulent scalar-flux models, a priori explorations are attempted by processing the LES data presently performed for channel flows under several flow-boundary conditions including shear-free boundaries. The present calibration has elucidated that the turbulent scalar-flux vectors obtainable from the simple generalized gradient-diffusion hypothesis (GGDH) hardly align with the simulation results in wall-shear flows at Pr≥0.71. However, the GGDH form returns a quite reasonable approximation in shear-free flow regions and/or lower Pr fluid cases. In the former flow cases, it has been found that an introduction of quadratic products of the Reynolds-stress tensor into the gradient diffusion model may improve the predictive performance.},

abstract = {The eddy viscosity at any location in fully developed turbulent flow in a round pipe is shown by an exact analysis to be simply the ratio of the shear stress due to the time-averaged turbulent fluctuations in the velocity to that due to the molecular motion and thus independent of its heuristic diffusional origin. The eddy conductivity in fully developed turbulent convection is similarly shown to be simply the ratio of the corresponding contributions to the radial heat flux density. However, while providing a quantitative physical rationale for the eddy viscosity and the eddy conductivity, the analysis that leads to this insight at the same time eliminates their conceptual value except in a historical sense. On the other hand, the turbulent Prandtl number, as redefined directly in terms of the time-averaged fluctuations, remains an essential parametric variable. The local fraction of the radial heat flux density due to turbulence (the replacement for the eddy conductivity as a variable) appears, on the ba...},

@article{Mejia2015,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Accurate subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar flux models are essential when large eddy simulation (LES) is used to represent flow, mixing and transport of passive and active scalars in engineering, and environmental applications in turbulent regime. Many SGS scalar flux models have been developed for flows with low Schmidt numbers (Sc), but their application to high Sc flows has important limitations. In high Sc flows, the behavior of the scalar field becomes anisotropic because of intermittency effects, phenomenon that must be accounted for by SGS scalar flux models. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the ability of three SGS scalar flux models to predict the scalar behavior of a high Sc-number flow configuration, namely the anisotropy-resolved SGS scalar flux model: (1) appropriate for high Sc-number flow configurations, and two additional SGS models (linear eddy diffusivity based SGS models) with (2) constant, and (3) dynamically calculated turbulent Schmidt number. The LES simulation results accomplished by these models are compared to each other and to experimental data of a turbulent round jet discharging a diluted scalar into a low-velocity coflowing water stream. The comparison of simulation results and experimental observations shows that, in general, all SGS models reproduce the mean filtered concentration distribution in radial direction. The dynamic eddy diffusivity and anisotropy models reproduce the rms of the concentration and SGS scalar fluxes distribution. In particular, the anisotropy model improves the prediction reliability of LES. However, the three models evaluated in this study cannot accurately predict the scalar behavior at the superviscous layer. Finally, this work demonstrates that complex models can achieve reliable predictions on reasonable grids using less computational effort, while simple models require fine grids with increased computational costs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
